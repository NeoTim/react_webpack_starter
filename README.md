# react_webpack_starter

Forked from https://github.com/bradtraversy/react_webpack_starter .

I splitted the repo into several branches, each of them adds one loader or plugin only.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Serve on localhost:3000
npm start

# Build for production
npm run build
```

## Branches

-   master: The most complex example with all the components together.
-   01-quick-start
-   02-css-loader
-   03-font-loader
-   04-image-loader
-   05-use-typescript
-   06-react-router
-   07-code-split-at-router-level
