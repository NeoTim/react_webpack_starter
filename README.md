# react_webpack_starter

Forked from https://github.com/bradtraversy/react_webpack_starter .

I splitted the repo into several branches, each of them adds one loader or plugin only.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Serve on localhost:3000
npm start

# Build for production
npm run build
```

## Branches

-   01-quick-start
